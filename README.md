# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

## Purpose 
    The Purpose of this project was to create a functional backend database for an E-Commerce website.  We were given a database schema, data to work with and a file structure.  We needed to add asscociations to our sequelize models and fill out Api routes to perform CRUD operations.  Lastly, we needed to test all of our api routes in Insomnia.  Creating my routes was the biggest challenge for me, but being able to test the routes right away in Insomnia was very helpful.  This made creating other routes easier because I came across the same errors. 

## Built with 
Sequelize, Express, Node, and Javascript 

## Acceptance Criteria 
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
